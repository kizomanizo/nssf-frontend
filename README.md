# NSSF Frontend

A barebones HTML, JS and CSS app that sends NSSF member number to NSSF servers through a CORS decoupling backend in order to retrieve member contribution balance totals.

The utility also shows the number of contributing employers and their names. User details are not shown as that is not part of this ethical hacking adventure that this application is intended-for.

To NSSF, please fix this, this API endpoint should not be a public facing one.
